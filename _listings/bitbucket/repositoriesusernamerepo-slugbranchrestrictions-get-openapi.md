        Creates a new repository.

        Note: In order to set the project for the newly created repository,
        pass in either the project key or the project UUID as part of the
        request body as shown in the examples below:

        ```
        $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
            "scm": "git",
            "project": {
                "key": "MARS"
            }
        }' https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/teamsinspace/hablanding
        ```

        or

        ```
        $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
            "scm": "git",
            "project": {
                "key": "{ba516952-992a-4c2d-acbd-17d502922f96}"
            }
        }' https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/teamsinspace/hablanding
        ```

        The project must only be assigned for repositories belonging to a team.
        If the repository owner is a team and the project is not provided, the
        repository is automatically assigned to the oldest project in the team.

        Note: In the examples above, the username `teamsinspace`,
        and/or the repository name `hablanding` can be replaced by UUIDs.

        Since this endpoint can be used to both update and to create a
        repository, the request body depends on the intent.

        ### Creation

        See the POST documentation for the repository endpoint for an example
        of the request body.

        ### Update

        Note: Changing the `name` of the repository will cause the location to
        be changed. This is because the URL of the repo is derived from the
        name (a process called slugification). In such a scenario, it is
        possible for the request to fail if the newly created slug conflicts
        with an existing repository's slug. But if there is no conflict,
        the new location will be returned in the `Location` header of the
        response.
